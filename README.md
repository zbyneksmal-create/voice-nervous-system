# voice-nervous-system

Short voice-based micro-interventions (60–90s) designed to reduce tension,
restore focus, and enable next practical action through nervous system regulation.

---

## What this is
A practical system of short voice interventions focused on real-life usability:
helping a person stabilize, regain orientation, and continue with the next step.

This project documents:
- structure of voice micro-interventions
- timing, pauses, and tone principles
- anonymized micro-case observations

---

## What this is not
- Not psychotherapy or clinical treatment
- Not diagnosis
- Not self-help motivation
- Not a medical product

---

## Core principle
The goal is not calmness.
The goal is functional continuity.

Reduce internal overload just enough
to allow one clear next action.

---

## Status
Early-stage documentation and field testing.
Content is intentionally minimal and practical.
