# voice-nervous-system

Short voice-based micro-interventions (60–90s) designed to reduce tension,
restore focus, and enable next practical action through nervous system regulation.

---

## What this is
A practical system of short voice interventions focused on real-life usability:
helping a person stabilize, regain orientation, and continue with the next step.

This project documents:
- structure of voice micro-interventions
- timing, pauses, and tone principles
- anonymized micro-case observations

---

## What this is not
- Not psychotherapy or clinical treatment
- Not diagnosis
- Not self-help motivation
- Not a medical product

---

## Core principle
The goal is not calmness.
The goal is functional continuity.

Reduce internal overload just enough
to allow one clear next action.

## Intervention types

- **Stabilize**
  Short intervention to reduce acute internal overload and stop escalation.

- **Re-orient**
  Helps restore basic orientation and attention to the present moment.

- **Release**
  Focused on releasing localized physical tension (jaw, shoulders, breath).

- **Transition**
  Supports moving from paralysis or hesitation into a clear next step.

- **Pre-load**
  Prepares the nervous system before interaction, task, or performance.

- **Night-reset**
  Reduces cognitive overactivity to allow rest or sleep onset.

## Micro-case example

**Context:** Acute mental overload with physical tension and inability to proceed.
**Intervention:** 75-second Stabilize intervention (slow tempo, long pauses).
**Immediate effect:** Noticeable reduction of tension and clearer perception.
**Outcome (10 min):** Able to complete one postponed practical task.
**Note:** Shorter duration proved more effective than longer guidance.


## Status
Early-stage documentation and field testing.
Content is intentionally minimal and practical.
