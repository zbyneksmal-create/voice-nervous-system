# voice-nervous-system

Short voice-based micro-interventions (60–90s) designed to reduce tension,
restore focus, and enable next practical action through nervous system regulation.

---

## What this is
A practical system of short voice interventions focused on real-life usability:
helping a person stabilize, regain orientation, and continue with the next step.

This project documents:
- structure of voice micro-interventions
- timing, pauses, and tone principles
- anonymized micro-case observations

---

## What this is not
- Not psychotherapy or clinical treatment
- Not diagnosis
- Not self-help motivation
- Not a medical product

---

## Core principle
The goal is not calmness.
The goal is functional continuity.

Reduce internal overload just enough
to allow one clear next action.

  Reduces cognitive overactivity to allow rest or sleep onset.


## Status
Early-stage documentation and field testing.
