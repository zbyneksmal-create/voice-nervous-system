# voice-nervous-system

Short voice-based micro-interventions (60–90s) designed to reduce internal overload, restore functional orientation, and enable the next practical action through nervous system regulation.

---

## What this is

A practical system of short voice interventions focused on real-life usability.

The purpose is not emotional processing or insight, but **functional continuity**:
helping a person stabilize, regain orientation, and proceed with one clear next step.

This project documents:

- structure of voice-based micro-interventions
- timing, pauses, and tone principles
- design constraints and usage boundaries
- anonymized micro-case observations

---

## What this is not

- Not psychotherapy
- Not clinical treatment
- Not diagnosis
- Not motivational self-help
- Not a medical product

No interpretation, emotional exploration, or therapeutic framing is involved.

## Core principle

The goal is not calmness.  
The goal is **functional continuity**.

Reduce internal overload just enough to allow **one clear next action**.

---

## Intervention types

### Stabilize  
Short intervention to reduce acute internal overload and stop escalation.

### Re-orient  
Restores basic orientation and attention to the present moment.

### Release  
Targets localized physical tension (jaw, shoulders, breathing patterns).

### Transition  
Supports movement from paralysis or hesitation into a defined next step.

### Pre-load  
Prepares the nervous system before interaction, task, or performance.

### Night-reset  
Reduces cognitive overactivity to allow rest or sleep onset.

## Micro-case example (anonymized)

**Context:**  
Acute mental overload with physical tension and inability to proceed with a postponed task.

**Intervention:**  
75-second *Stabilize* intervention (slow tempo, long pauses, neutral language).

**Immediate effect:**  
Noticeable reduction in tension and clearer perceptual field.

**Outcome (10 min):**  
User completed one postponed practical task without further guidance.

**Observation:**  
Short duration proved more effective than longer instruction.

## Design constraints

- No interpretation or analysis during delivery
- Neutral, non-suggestive language
- Short duration (60–90s maximum)
- One functional goal per intervention
- Voice leads action, not introspection

---

## Voice parameters

- Slow, steady tempo
- Long pauses allowed
- Low emotional modulation
- Clear articulation
- No metaphorical or symbolic language

---

## Intended usage contexts

- Acute overload or shutdown
- Task paralysis or hesitation
- Transition between activities
- Pre-interaction stabilization
- Night-time cognitive overactivation

---

## Status

Early-stage documentation and field testing.  
Content is intentionally minimal, practical, and system-oriented.
